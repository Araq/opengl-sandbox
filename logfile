# Work on ast transformation to single static assignments


notes from before. The AST from the macro shoulld be transformed into
a list of single static assingments. Each assingment/identifier should
a have constraint that declares, wher the value can be calculated.

a value can be calculated on the CPU, the Fragment-Shader, or the
Vertex-Shader.


a constrait can be defined explicitly:

let a {.VS.} = ...
let b {.FS.} = ...

a constraint can be defined implicitly:

let a = foo(vertex.position)
# this forces a to be calculated in the vertex-shader.
gl.Position = bar(a)

The AST can be transformed to single static assignments. Typechecking
the AST removes pragma expressions, that means I can't use pragma
expressions to store the constraints. My solution to this problem is
to create a table that maps from symbols of the ast to the
constraints. The table needs to be cleared each time the macro is
called.

Enabling/disabling clipping planes should be handled somehow.  The
Uniforms are extracted simply by iterating the single static
assignments. Whenever a symbol is used that is not defined in the
block of code it is assumed to be a uniform.  compile time constants
are compiled as values, not uniforms into the glsl source code.
